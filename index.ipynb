    "Our task is to build an inferential linear regression model. Our model will help Opendoor make more accurate offers in accordance with their valuation process. We will follow the assumptions of linear regression which are linearity, independence, normality, and homoscedasticity. We will also strive to have a high R^2 value, signaling that our parameters are explaining much of the total variance in house sales."

    "Our stakeholder is Opendoor. Opendoor makes cash offers for homes and resells them. They perform repairs on the home if necessary. They also offer a listing service. They make their profits from fees, not from buying low and selling high. We will be assisting this company in the King County, Washington area. The county seat is Seattle. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Opendoor process begins with evaluations of a home through photos, listed upgrades, and listed amenities. Next, they find comparable homes or 'comps' to provide a base range. Next, they make adjustments to the offer based on differences between comps. These differences can include features or neighborhood trends. Lastly, they make an offer and send someone to inspect the home.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our job is to analyze the King County data set and provide solid valuation models that can assist with finding comp valuations, and then detailing the needed adjustments. Different markets have slight differences, and we will report on the most important parameters when assessing home values in the King County area. Since they also do repairs, we will also look at factors that assess the condition and amount of repairs likely needed in the property. Opendoor will be able to use our recommendations to make fair offers in the King County area."
